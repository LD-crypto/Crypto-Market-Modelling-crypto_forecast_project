feature_dictionary
================================

The scripts in the features folder output a mass set of dervied market features from sampled trade data. The features of the sampled data and the mass derived features are described in this document. The derived features are so-called because they are all a function of the time-series of the raw sampled features.

#########
raw sampled features:

date:		timestamp of when the sample was taken
open:		first price over the sample period ('o')
high:		highest price over the sample ('h')
low:		lowest price over the sample ('l')
close:		last price over the sample ('c',' ')
wavg:		weighted average of the price
volume:		sum of the amount of the assets traded over sample
value:		sum of the value traded over the sample [value = price*volume]

##########
derived features:

ret:		single period return of closing price
log_:		the natural log of ___
oh,ol,...: 	the difference of the log_ feature where {o = open, h = high, l = low, c = close}
logret:		single period difference of logclose, ie. log_return
X_1d__:		X period difference of log___, approximate first differential
X_2d__:		X period difference of the approx. first differential, approximate second differential
sma_X:		simple moving average of feature __ where {nan = close, h = high, l = low} computed over rolling window size X
stdX:		standard deviation of logret over window size X
tr:		true range, a function of open, high, low, close.
atrX:		average true range over window size X
dvol_:		daily volatility of price __
cciX:		commodity channel index computed over X periods
rsiX:		relative strength index computed over X periods
wrX:		williams %R computed over X periods
dma_X-Y:	difference between the smaX and smaY of __ price
lasthighX:	difference between logclose and highest loghigh price over X periods
lastlowX:	difference between logcloser and lowest loglow over X periods
